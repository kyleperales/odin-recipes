<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, rinsed and patted dry</li>
    <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>½ cup apple cider vinegar</li>

<h3>Steps</h3>

    <li>
        Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat until oil is shimmering.
        Cook garlic in oil for no more than 30 seconds.
        Add all of the chicken to the pot; cook, stirring frequently, until chicken is white all over. Do not brown.

    <li>
        Pour in soy sauce, vinegar, and water, and add the pickling spice.
        Make sure the spice ball is submerged. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer,
        and place lid on pot so that some steam can escape. Simmer for 1 hour, or until chicken is very tender.
